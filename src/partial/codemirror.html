<textarea style="width: 100%; height: 100%;">
  Here is the solution I finally came up with when using a div as a container for a dynamic background.

Remove the z-index for non-background uses.
Remove left or right for a full height column.
Remove top or bottom for a full width row.
EDIT 1: CSS below has been edited because it did not show correctly in FF and Chrome. moved position:relative to be on the HTML and set the body to height:100% instead of min-height:100%.

EDIT 2: Added extra comments to CSS. Added some more instructions above.

The CSS:

html{
    min-height:100%;/* make sure it is at least as tall as the viewport */
    position:relative
}
body{
    height:100% /* force the BODY element to match the height of the HTML element */
}
#cloud-container{
    position:absolute;
    top:0;
    bottom:0;
    left:0;
    right:0;
    overflow:hidden;
    z-index:-1
}
The html:

Why?

html{min-height:100%;position:relative}
Without this the cloud-container DIV is removed from the HTML's layout context. position: relative ensures that the DIV remains inside the HTML box when it is drawn so that bottom:0 refers to the bottom of the HTML box. You can
</textarea>
